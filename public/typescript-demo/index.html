<p>To compile the typescript you can run one of two options</p>
<ul>
  <li><pre>npm run-script build</pre></li>
  <li><pre>npm run-script watch</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>
  Similar to how nodemon refeshes on js file change, the tsc watch option
  watches typescript files for changes and then compiles them on the fly.
  Try out both to get a feel for them.
</p>
<p>
  As an asside, We don't necessarily need nodemon to start the server
  because I don't see us changing server.ts often enough to benefit from
  the change. Feel free to take this thought with a grain of salt.
</p>
<p>
  We will need to add javascript files to the .gitignore. I'll add it as a
  task to our Loom Game Tasks spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>Now check the console to see what this imported js did</p>
<script src="main.js" type="module"></script>
